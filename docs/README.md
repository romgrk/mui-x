# MUI X docs

This is the documentation website of MUI X.

To start the docs site in development mode, from the project root, run:

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm docs:dev
```

If you do not have pnpm installed, follow the instructions on the [pnpm website](https://pnpm.io/installation).

_DO NOT USE NPM, use pnpm to install the dependencies._
